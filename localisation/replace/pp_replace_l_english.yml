It is primarily determined by ensuring that all drones have their basic needs for §Y$PLANET_AMENITIES_TITLE$§! fulfilled. A planet with high $PLANET_STABILITY_TITLE$ will have increased resource production, while a planet with low $PLANET_STABILITY_TITLE$ will suffer penalties and may experience negative events or even a full-scale §RRevolt§! if there are non-drone Pops present on the planet.§!"
