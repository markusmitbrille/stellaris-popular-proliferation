A planet with high $PLANET_STABILITY_TITLE$ will have increased resource production, while a planet with low $PLANET_STABILITY_TITLE$ will suffer penalties and may experience negative events or even a full-scale §RRevolt§!.§!"

It is primarily determined by ensuring that all drones have their basic needs for §Y$PLANET_AMENITIES_TITLE$§! fulfilled. A planet with high $PLANET_STABILITY_TITLE$ will have increased resource production, while a planet with low $PLANET_STABILITY_TITLE$ will suffer penalties and may experience negative events or even a full-scale §RRevolt§! if there are non-drone Pops present on the planet.§!"

 decision_discourage_growth_desc:1 "If resources and living space are at a premium, population planning might be necessary on this world. Costly measures designed to voluntarily curtail population growth will be taken. Approval ratings will take a hit, but emigration might occur."
